The game will literally just randomly crash for no reason when you start the game with gradle and I have zero idea why smth with code chicken lib.

Do not move the dependencies around in dependencies.gradle you will probably break something.
It literally would not work until I put it in the specific order I did and it just magically worked
Moving anything will probably break it, so don't do that
Breathing wrong will probably break it, so don't do that either

GregTech JEI Plugin may just randomly decide to not work in dev environment, no idea why

Do not breathe wrong, or the game might crash
