The game will literally just crash for no reason when you start the game via IntelliJ and I have zero idea why smth with code chicken lib.

Do not move the dependencies around in dependencies.gradle you will probably break something.
It literally would not work until I put it in the specific order I did and it just magically worked
Moving anything will probably break it, so don't do that

Going to Aether crashes the game, but works fine in a non dev environment. Could be an issue with modern syntax in dev workspace, otherwise, kinda spooky ngl
Going to other MC4 planets probably crashes the game
